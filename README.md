This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio, built to showcase my skills as a "Full-Stack AI Orchestrator."

---

## 🎯 Project Goal & Philosophy

This portfolio was built with a single, clear objective: to pass a recruiter's "6-second test."

The entire architecture and design are "Recruiter-Optimized," prioritizing:

- **Speed:** Built as a Static Site (SSG) with Next.js for instant-on loading.
- **Clarity:** An "above-the-fold" Hero section that immediately states who I am and what I do.
- **Proof:** Key projects and resume data are presented clearly, corroborating my "AI Orchestrator" narrative from my resume.
- **Minimalism:** A "Minimalist/Dark" theme that is professional, clean, and avoids all feature-creep (like light/dark toggles).
